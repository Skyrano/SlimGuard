SlimGuard is a secure dynamic memory allocator whose design is driven by memory
efficiency. We redesign the security features of state-of-the-art allocators
with memory efficiency in mind. SlimGuard protects against widespread
heap-related attacks such as overflows, over-reads, double/invalid free, and
use-after-free. Among other features, SlimGuard uses an efficient fine-grain
size classes indexing mechanism and implements a novel dynamic canary scheme
optimized for memory overhead reduction.
